                                One game consists of any number of rounds, where one person is the artist and the others are the guessers. The artist will draw out their chosen word while the others will have to guess what it is in order to gain points.<br/>
                                The person with the most points when all the rounds are up will then be crowned the winner. WOOOOOO!

                                <b>Guesser:</b> When you're a guesser, you'll have to try to figure out what the artist is drawing. Type your guess into the chat and if you're right, you'll get points!<br/>
                                Be fast though; the earlier you guess the drawn word, the more points you get.<br/>
